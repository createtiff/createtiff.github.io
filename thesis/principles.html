				Interface
				</br></br>
				1. a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact.
				</br>
				2. a device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer.
				</br></br>
				As in 2020, more than ever in history, we live in an overabundance of information and we make most of our communications through an interface. ‘Design’ stands between humans and any non human entity as an interface and communication from one entity to another is transmitted through a device despite the form being written, verbal, or visual. Hence, I am proposing a web-based manifesto to advocate optimizing interface and incorporate design thinking for product development to advance practices of user interface.
				</br></br>
				Translate information into structural visual forms that make information digestible, feasible and pleasing to the eye. Declutter noises in interfaces and conduct systematically focused approaches. Minimize the gap between content and interpretation by thinking from the users’ perspective. Convey the meaning and intention through streamlined visual experiences to inspire valuable engagement from the users.
