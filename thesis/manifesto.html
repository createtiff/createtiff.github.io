					Optimizing Interface
					</div>

			<div class="bodytext">
				In 2020, now more than ever in history, we are living in a world where we make most of our communications through an interface. ‘Design’ stands between humans and any non human entity as an interface as communication from one entity to another is being transmitted through a device despite the form being written, verbal, or visual. Creating an interface that not only is built for productive user experience but also to minimize digital burnout is necessary. Let's form sustainable digital experience.
				</br></br>
				Optimize interface design by incorporating visual perception to the use of digital technology. Translate information into structural visual forms that make information digestible, feasible and pleasing to the eye. Declutter noises in interfaces and conduct systematically focused approaches. Minimize the gap between content and interpretation by thinking from the users’ perspective. Convey the meaning and intention through streamlined visual experiences to bring valuable engagement from the users.
