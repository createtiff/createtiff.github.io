	<div class="simba">
	Nala
	You find my mother and rally
	the lionesses
	I'll look for Scar</div>

	<div class="scar">Sarabi!</div>	
	(Simba gasps)

	(Hyenas growl at Sarabi)

	<div class="sarabi">Yes Scar...?</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Where is your hunting party?
	They're not doing their job.</div>

	<div class="sarabi">
	Scar, there is no food.
	The herds have moved on.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	(in denial) No.
	You're just not looking hard enough.</div>

	<div class="sarabi">
	It's over. There is nothing left.
	We only have one choice.
	We must leave Pride Rock.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	We're not going anywhere.</div>

	<div class="sarabi">
	Then you have sentenced us to death!</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Then so be it.</div>

	<div class="sarabi">
	(in disbelief) You can't do that.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	I am the king.
	I can do whatever I want.</div>

	<div class="sarabi">
	If you were half the king Mufasa was...</div>

	<div class="scar">
	(interrupting)
	I'm 10 times the king Mufasa was!</div>

	(Simba growls)

	<div class="scar">
	 (in shock)
	Mufasa! No, you're dead...</div>

	<div class="sarabi">
	(painfully groans and breathless)
	Mufasa?</div>

	<div class="simba">
	No, it's me.</div>

	<div class="sarabi"> (still out of breath)
	Simba?! You're alive?! How can that be?</div>

	<div class="simba">
	It doesn't matter.
	I'm home.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	(in slight shock) Simba?
	(fake happily) Simba. Oh, I'm
	a little surprised to see you
	(irritated) alive...</div>

	(Hyenas gulp worryly)

	<div class="simba"> (threatening)
	Give me one good reason why
	I shouldn't rip you apart.</div>

	<div class="scar"> (making excuses)
	Oh, Simba. You must understand.
	The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
	"Simba" (interrupting)
	...Are no longer yours. Step down Scar.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Oh, he he, I would naturally,
	but however there is one little problem.
	You see them?
	(points up to the growling hyena horde)
	They think I'm king.</div>

	<div class="nala">
	Well, we don't.
	Simba's the rightful king.</div>

	<div class="simba">
	The choice is yours, Scar.
	Either step down or a fight.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Oh, must this all end in violence?
	(gaining some confidence)
	I'd hate to be responsible for the
	death of a family member.
	Wouldn't you agree Simba?</div>

	<div class="simba">
	That's not going to work Scar.
	I've put it behind me.</div>

	<div class="scar"> (very confident now)
	And what about your faithful subjects?
	Have they put it behind them?</div>

	<div class="nala">
	Simba, what is he talking about?</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Ah, so you haven't told them your
	little secret. Well, Simba,
	now's your chance to tell them.
	Tell them who is responsible for
	Mufasa's death.</div>

	<div class="simba"> (sadly)
	I am.</div>

	<div class="sarabi"> (in disbelief and grieving)
	It's not true.
	Tell me it's not true.</div>

	<div class="simba"> (regretful)
	It's true.</div>

	<div class="scar"> (judging and threatening)
	You see! He admits it! Murderer!</div>

	<div class="simba"> (trying to defend himself)
	No, it was an accident.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	If it weren't for you,
	Mufasa would still be alive.
	It's your fault he's dead.
	Do you deny it?</div>

	<div class="simba">
	No.</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Then you're guilty!</div>

	<div class="simba"> (afraid)
	No, I'm not a murderer!</div>

	<div class="scar">
	Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again.
	But this time,
	Daddy isn't here to save you.
	And now everyone
	knows
	why!</div>

	(Simba slips and gasps)

	<div class="nala">
	Simba!
	</div>
