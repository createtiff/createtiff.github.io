	<div class="scar">SARABI!!</div>	
<br>
	<div class="sarabi1">Yes Scar...?</div>
<br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	<em>Where</em> is your hunting party?
	<br>
	They're not doing their <em>job</em>.</div>
<br><br><br><br><br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	Scar, there is no food.
	The herds have moved on.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	NO.
	<br>
	You're just not looking hard enough.</div>
<br>
	<div class="sarabi2">
	<em>It's over.</em>
	<br><br> 
	There is nothing left.
	<br><br>
	We only have one choice.
	<br><br>
	We must leave Pride Rock.</div>
<br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	We're not going anywhere.</div>
<br><br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	<b>Then you have sentenced us to death!</b></div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	Then so be it.</div>
<br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	<small>You can't do that.</small></div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	<em>I am the king.</em>
	<br>
	I can do whatever I want.</div>
<br><br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	<strong><em>If you were half the king Mufasa was...</em></strong></div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	I'm 10 times the king Mufasa was!</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<div class="simba">
	(Growl)</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	Mufasa! No, you're dead...</div>
<br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	Mufasa?</div>
<br>
	<div class="simba">
	No, it's me.</div>
<br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	Simba?! You're alive?! 
	<br>
	How can that be?</div>
<br>
	<div class="simba">
	It doesn't matter.
	<br>
	I'm home.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	Simba?
	<br>
	Simba. Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you,?
	<br>
	alive...</div>
<br>

	<div class="simba">
	Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	Oh, Simba. You must understand.
	<br>
	The pressures of ruling a kingdom...</div>
<br>	
	<div class="simba">
	...Are no longer yours. Step down Scar.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	Oh, he he, I would naturally,
	<br>
	but however there is one little problem.
	<br>
	You see them?
	<br>
	They think I'm king.</div>
<br>
	<div class="nala">
	Well, we don't.
	<br>
	Simba's the rightful king.</div>
<br>
	<div class="simba">
	The choice is yours, Scar.
	<br>
	Either step down or a fight.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	Oh, must this all end in violence?
	<br>
	I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
	<br>
	Wouldn't you agree Simba?</div>
<br>
	<div class="simba">
	That's not going to work Scar.
	<br>
	I've put it behind me.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	And what about your faithful subjects?
	<br>
	Have they put it behind them?</div>
<br>
	<div class="nala">
	Simba, what is he talking about?</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	Ah, so you haven't told them your little secret.
	<br>
	Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.
	<br>
	Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.</div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="simba">
	I am.</div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="sarabi">
	<strong>It's not true.
	<br><br>
	Tell me it's not true.</strong></div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="simba">
	It's true.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	You see! He admits it! 
	<br>
	MURDERER!</div>
<br>
	<div class="simba"> 
	No, it was an accident.</div>
<br>
	<div class="scar">
	If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive.
	<br>
	It's your fault he's dead.
	<br>
	Do you deny it?</div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="simba">
	No.</div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	Then you're guilty!</div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="simba">
	No, I'm not a murderer!</div>
<br><br><br>
	<div class="scar">
	Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again.
	<br>
	But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you.
	<br>
	And now everyone knows why!</div>
<br>
	<div class="nala">
	Simba!
