		<h1> <div class="korean">떡국</div>Dduk Guk<br><div class="korean0"> Korean Rice Cake Soup </div></h1>
			<div class="description">Dduk Guk is a dish that I ate every single year especially during the beginning of each year and quite often throughout the year. It is meaningful in a way that I rarely eat it from outside of home, I mainly eat homecooked Dduk Guk made by my grandma or my mom. It is a warm dish that is well balanced with various nutrients that not only warms my body up but also my heart.</div>

			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<h3>Beef Broth:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>12 cups (3 quarts) cold water</li>
				<li>½ pound beef brisket</li>
				<li>1 medium onion, peeled and halved</li>
				<li>8 cloves of garlic, peeled and left whole</li>
				<li>3 scallions white and pale green parts,
					<br> (dark green parts reserved)</li>
				<li>2-3 tablespoons Korean soup soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
				<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Garnish:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Cooked beef brisket removed from the broth, thinly shredded</li>
				<li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
				<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
				<li>2 eggs (or 1 egg for every 2 people)</li>
				<li>Thinly sliced scallions (from the reserved dark green parts)</li>
				<li>Crumbled or thinly sliced gim (dried seasoned seaweed/ laver)</li>
				<li>4 cups sliced dduk, Korean rice cakes (or 1 cup per person),<br>

			</ul>

		<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Place the cold water, beef, onion, scallion ends, and garlic in a large pot, cover and bring to a gentle boil. Skim off the scum that forms with a spoon or ladle, and discard. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer, covered, until the meat is tender enough to shred easily, about 1 ½ - 2 hours.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Meanwhile, work on your garnishes. To make the egg garnish, separate the yolks from the whites. Whisk the yolks. Heat a lightly oiled small nonstick pan over medium low heat. Pour the yolks into a thin layer, by spreading it with a spoon. Cook each side, but do not brown the egg. Slice your omelette into thin strips. Lightly beat the whites and set aside.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Remove the cooked meat from the broth and cool slightly. Shred the beef into thin strips and combine well with the minced garlic, sesame oil, salt, and pepper to taste. Slice the scallion diagonally into thin strips. Slice your gim (roasted dried seaweed) into thin strips, or crumble into pieces using your hands. Set everything aside.</li>
				<br>
				<li>With a skimmer, remove the vegetables from the broth and discard. Return the broth to a boil. Stir in soup soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. If cooking for less than 4 people, scoop out some broth into a smaller pot to cook your rice cakes and save the rest of the broth for later. You do this because the rice cakes tend to release starches into the broth. You can always freeze any leftover broth!</li>
				<br>
				<li>Drain the soaked rice cake slices and boil in the broth until soft, but not mushy, usually about 2-4 minutes, or until they rise to the top. Slowly stream in the egg white to form ribbons in the soup. Turn it off the heat once the egg is cooked. Ladle the hot soup into individual bowls and garnish with some of the seasoned shredded beef, egg yolk strips, sliced scallions, and gim strips.</li>
