			<div class="description">Dduk Guk, a korean traditional dish, is a meaningful heritage food for me. In korean culture, we often eat Dduk Guk to celebrate the Lunar New Year. My grandmother often cooked Dduk Guk for our family for our speacial event. Needless to say, Dduk guk is a warm dish that fills up my heart and body, but also a powerful dish that is well balanced with nutrients.</div>
