			<div class="description">Dduk Guk is a dish that I ate every single year especially during the beginning of each year and quite often throughout the year. It is meaningful in a way that I rarely eat it from outside of home, I mainly eat homecooked Dduk Guk made by my grandma or my mom. It is a warm dish that is well balanced with various nutrients that not only warms my body up but also my heart.</div>
