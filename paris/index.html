			Wrapping up my short-lived study abroad days in Paris, it was truly an eye-opening experience. As, a person who did not grow up in the western cultural context neither in Western countries nor westernized international education system, I only knew bits and pieces of the cultural elements of French culture, French history, and knew very little about Paris. All I knew about France was the Eiffel Tower, Arc the Triomphe, Musée d'Orsay, Claude Monet, the Louvre, the Pompidou center, French haute couture, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI being guillotined, Versailles and the French Revolution, Napoleon, baguette and croissant.

			Paris welcomed me this winter on December 18th, with its longest transport strike that lasted for 56 days, revealed me it’s beautiful ups and downs from the sunny and bright days to the cloudy and gloomy days and went into hibernation, sending me off during its confined state on April 9th. It was truly not an easy experience, living in a completely foreign environment during this time in history, however, reflecting back, I believe I had a valuable experience without doubt, being able to gain interest in not only the glory of France but also the non-glamorous days, the historical events that caused change, deeper thinking of the French, which formed what Paris is now. I have gained a better understanding of what Paris is, things behind what is called Paris, what have been built, revolutions, battles and efforts that has been made by radical leaders or the citizens and the blood and human labor that has been sacrificed in constructing and paving the city.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			A time of growth, balanced time between struggles and awe, it will forever be a notable lifelong memory that will be carried on during my life.
			Time of connecting the dots as an individual trying to figure out life and the world during the quarter-life crisis, by learning about Paris, French history, Western history, people and history that shaped a part of world we are living in today, the beauty and imperfection of people, history, and culture.
